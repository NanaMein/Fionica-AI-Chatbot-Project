I'm going to choose response number 9: "I think it's a day to reflect on our journey to self-governance and how far we've come." I like this response because it shows that I'm thoughtful and considerate of the country's history and progress. It also opens up the conversation to discuss the significance of independence and how it has impacted the country's development. Plus, it's a great way to show my appreciation for the sacrifices made by our heroes who fought for our freedom!
