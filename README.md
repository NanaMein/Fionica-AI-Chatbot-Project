# Fionica-AI-Chatbot-Project
An AI chatbot project that i intend to develop and use from present to future uses. 

Im thinking of first building an AI Chatbot as base, then add RAG and Prompt Engineering make up the whole Chatbot first
And then will add Ai Agents to increase capabilities and make it scalable. But for now will make a base for it. 

ill be switching to Crew.AI

because of some errors in 3.13 like bugs and uncompatability of some weird stuffs. im testing if 3.12 and 3.11 because the ones in the youtube
tutorials dont use 3.13 so im thinking its not me who has a problem in coding. but the version itself. but will test in order to prove my 
evidence
